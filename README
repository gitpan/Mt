Mt.pm is a perl module providing object-like wrapping of the Unix
'mt' command (tape manager). It doesn't use any library calls, but
rather makes system() calls for properly formatted 'mt' commands.

The module requires perl 5.6.0 (it uses 'our' pragma).

Installation as usual:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Documentation is contained within the module.
